aboutme: >
  I am a software engineer who likes making things right. I have worked with a different technology stacks like:
  PHP, Node, golang, ruby, kubernetes, MongoDB and HTML5. As frontend developer,  I have created some rich user interfaces thanks to
  some javascript frameworks as Angular or Backbone. In the other hand, as backend developer I have built some rest APIs and middleware
  components, although nowadays I have involved trying to apply DDD concepts over our micro services platform.
  Further, due to my current job I have improved drastically my skills as devOps operating some kubernetes clusters,
  making repetitive tasks run automatically and getting CD/CI to our work days.
