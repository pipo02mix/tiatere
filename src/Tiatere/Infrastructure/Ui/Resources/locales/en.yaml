aboutme: >
  I am a software engineer who likes making things right. I have worked with a different set of technologies like:
  PHP, Node, golang, ruby, kubernetes, MongoDB or HTML5. My early days as a developer I was focussed in the frontend. I have created some rich user interfaces thanks to some javascript frameworks as Angular or Backbone. Over time I moved my interests to backend development. I have been involved in building some rest APIs and middleware components. Nowadays, I have walked away from pure development, and I have started to work more in processes and automation.
  I really like to read and practice about 'Domain Driven Design' and DevOps concepts. At the same time, I love to share knowledge either in meetups or workshops.
