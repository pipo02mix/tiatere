aboutme: >
  I am a software engineer who likes making the things right. I used to work with a different stack of technologies like:
  PHP, Nodejs, golang, ruby, kubernetes y HTML5. As frontend developer,  I have created some rich user interfaces thanks to
  some javascript frameworks as Angular or Backbone. In the other hand, as backend developer I have built some rest APIs, although
  nowadays I have involved trying to apply DDD concepts over our micro services platform. Further, due to my current job I have
  improved drastically my skills as devOops operating some kubernetes clusters, making repetitive tasks run automatically and
  getting CD/CI to our work days.
